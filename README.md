# Feedback Rating System

## Project Overview

This is a simple **Feedback Rating System** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **MySQL**. Users can submit feedback ratings (e.g., Bad, Average, Good) by clicking on rating images (emojis). The submitted rating is sent to the server, which logs the rating to the console and can store it in a MySQL database. The system is designed to be user-friendly and can later be extended with additional features.

### Features:
- Users can click on images (emojis) to submit feedback.
- Ratings are sent to the server via a **POST request**.
- The server logs the received rating and stores it in a MySQL database.
- The interface resets after submission, and users can submit multiple feedbacks.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
- **SQLite**: Make sure SQLite is installed.

### Steps to Setup the Project

1. **Download the project files**:
   Download the project files and place them in a directory on your machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages by running:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run the Server**: 
    Start the server using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start

This will start the Node.js server on port 3000 by default.
The SQLite database is saved in feedback.db.

4. **Access the Feedback Form**:
    Open your web browser and go to:
    http://localhost:3000/
